# Calendar
Creates multiple versions of a calendar with events from my second programming class, Programming and Problem Solving II at the University of Mount Union.

Some code is supplied by Dr. James Klayder and modified by Alec Barker. Some helper files are used that were created for Princeton University's CS department.

To use the program, run main/CalendarFrame.java

If using events, the text file must be in the inputFiles package.

If using the HTML files, they will be located in the outputFiles package.

There are options to do the following:
- Display which day the first of each month is
- Display which day the first and last of each month is
- Display a calendar in a simple monthly text format
- List events occurring within a year from a text file
- Display a calendar in a simple monthly text format that includes events for each month from a text file
- Display a calendar in a simple monthly text format that is output to an HTML file
- Use an HTML table to display a calendar that is output to an HTML file
- Use an HTML table to display a calendar with events from a text file displayed on the calendar that is output to an HTML file
- Use an HTML table to display a calendar with links to seperate webpages about events from a text file that is output to an HTML file
